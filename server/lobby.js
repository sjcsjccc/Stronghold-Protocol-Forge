// server/lobby.js — rooms, seats, host, AI seats, ready/start, reconnect, and room → Match wiring
// (DESIGN §2, §6.1 LOBBY, §8.1). Implements the handler interface consumed by server/net.js.
//
// Rules (the choices where DESIGN is silent are marked ▸):
//   * Rooms are keyed by 4-letter codes from an unambiguous alphabet (no I/O, letters only). Join codes are
//     case-insensitive.
//   * 'solo' rooms hold exactly one human and never bots. 'coop' rooms have 4 seats (humans + AI bots).
//     Humans and bots take the lowest free seat index; seat indexes never compact.
//   * ▸ Being in a LOBBY room and sending room.create / room.join implicitly leaves it. While your room is
//     in a match, create/join of another room fails with ROOM_STARTED (send g.leave or room.leave first).
//   * room.create {mode, difficulty?, test?}: ▸ without a difficulty the room starts at DEFAULT_DIFFICULTY (标准) and the
//     host changes it in the room — the event's 联合模拟 creates the room first (research 06 §3.2), the starting
//     difficulty is not recorded [ASSUMED: 标准, the first one unlocked; the event room research 06 §3.2 describes shows
//     ♜ 标准模拟 in its footer pill]. The game's own lobby always sends the remembered one.
//   * Host-only: room.setDifficulty, room.setAiPicksLast, room.setSoloUnlimited, room.addBot, room.removeBot, room.kick,
//     room.start.
//     ▸ Changing the difficulty or the AI-picks-last option (co-op only) un-readies the other humans.
//     ▸ 「不限时」 (room.setSoloUnlimited { on }, DESIGN §37.23.10): a solo room of a version whose rules.soloTimed is
//       true, off by default. On, the match is built with opts.soloUnlimited (preparation and 机变 untimed — the existing
//       Match opt-out). room.state carries `soloUnlimited: true` only while it is on, so a default room.state stays
//       identical. A switch to a version whose solo is not timed clears it. A create that sends the key on a co-op room
//       or an untimed version is ignored.
//     ▸ room.start requires every other human to be connected and ready; the host's start counts as the host's
//     ready (the host may still toggle room.ready for display).
//   * room.kick {seat, playerId} (community report #17, owner approved): before the match only, the host removes another
//     human like an AI seat (an AI seat stays room.removeBot's; never the host itself). `playerId` names the player the
//     host confirmed: a seat that changed hands meanwhile (left, someone else joined) is refused with BAD_TARGET. The
//     seat is freed at once and the player gets `room.closed {reason:'kicked'}` — now, or on the next resume when
//     offline (with the result replay, as the grace timeout) —, so the reconnect token no longer leads back to the seat
//     (it stays the player's identity: net.js sessions belong to players, not seats). ▸ No ban: the player may join
//     again with the code.
//   * Host migration: when the host leaves (or is removed), the lowest-seat remaining human (connected
//     ones first) becomes host. A room without humans is disposed (bots never keep a room alive).
//   * Disconnect in LOBBY: the seat shows connected=false and is freed after `lobbyGraceMs` (60 s); a
//     session that comes back after that gets `room.closed {reason:'timeout'}`.
//     Disconnect in a match: the seat is kept and match.onDisconnect(playerId) is called.
//   * Reconnect: `hello` with a known token (reconnect window, 10 min, see net.js) rebinds the session;
//     the lobby then broadcasts room.state and, in a match, calls match.onReconnect(playerId).
//     Solo runs (下半: "休整期及机变阶段没有时间限制…24小时内随时返回", research 01 §1 / 06 §17): a session that drops
//     while its solo room's match runs stays resumable for the official `config.constants.singleReconnectTime`
//     (86400 s; option `soloReconnectWindowMs` overrides it) instead of the 10-minute window (net.js
//     session.resumeWindowMs, set at every disconnect). 第一期's constData has no singleReconnectTime, so that solo
//     uses the same 24 h figure as a carried-over convenience [ASSUMED] — not because the run is untimed (a 第一期 solo
//     is timed unless the room's 「不限时」 is on, §37.23.10). Only after that does expiry turn into
//     match.onLeave ('abandoned'). The extension outlives the match, so a run that ended meanwhile (e.g. a server-run
//     Final Assault) still shows its result on the player's return.
//     A repeated hello on a live connection is a full resync: room.state goes to the requester only
//     (broadcast only when the seat visibly changed, e.g. a rename in LOBBY); the heavy part (match.onReconnect,
//     or the result replay below) runs at most once per `resyncMinGapMs` per session — extra requests inside
//     that window coalesce into one deferred resync, so hello spam cannot amplify into ~15 KB per request.
//   * Result replay: the match's final m.public and each human's m.result are kept after the match ends. A
//     human who resyncs (resume after a drop, a reloaded tab, a repeated hello) while the room is back in LOBBY
//     gets room.state followed by those two frames again, until they act in the room (ready, difficulty, the
//     AI-picks-last option, AI seats, start), leave it, or a new match starts. A human removed by the lobby grace
//     gets them right after `room.closed {timeout}` on their next resume (Match.onReconnect cannot do this: the
//     lobby drops the match reference at onEnd and disposes it on the next macrotask).
//   * Per-network limits (internet clients only, see net.js clientAddress): at most `maxRoomsPerAddr` rooms
//     created from one network may exist at once and at most `maxMatchesPerAddr` matches started from one
//     network may run at once (room.create / room.start → ERR.RATE). Without them a socket loop could fill
//     `maxRooms` or keep hundreds of unattended matches simulating for the whole reconnect window.
//   * Permanent departure during a match (room.leave, g.leave, reconnect window expired): the seat is
//     marked departed (shown as connected=false), match.onLeave(playerId) is called, and the seat is freed
//     when the match ends. 'g.leave' is handled here and never reaches match.handle().
//   * All other 'g.*' messages go to room.match.handle(playerId, msg); its {ok}/{error} becomes the reply.
//   * Match lifecycle: room.start → new Match({...}) → room.state (inMatch=true) → match.start(). The match gets
//     `matchNo` = the room's match number (1, 2, …): with the seed it keeps battleIds unique across the room's
//     matches, so a late b.progress / b.result of the previous match is ignored by the next one (DESIGN §14).
//     onEnd(summary) → room back to LOBBY (departed seats freed, humans un-readied, disconnected humans
//     get the lobby grace), dispose() on the next macrotask. Players can start again.
//   * room.closed reasons: 'timeout' (removed after lobby grace), 'kicked' (room.kick, room.removeSpectator), 'empty' (a
//     spectator whose room lost its last player), 'shutdown' (server stopping).
//   * Operator loadout (DESIGN §16): room.loadout { entries } is checked strictly against the game data
//     (shared/protocol.js checkLoadout: known visible chess, a skill index legal for the normal AND the elite status, a
//     module of the elite or 'none'; any bad entry rejects the whole message, nothing is stored). ▸ It is stored on the
//     session (it follows the player into every room they create/join, and survives a resume) and on the seat; the
//     match receives seats[].loadout (bots: none — they fight with the defaults). ▸ Accepted any time: in a LOBBY room
//     (or outside a room) it simply replaces the stored one; while the room's match runs it is also handed to
//     match.setLoadout(playerId, loadout), which accepts it only during INFO_CHECK (the 干员调配 entry of the briefing)
//     and refuses it afterwards (WRONG_PHASE: the match's loadout is locked, the stored one applies to the next match).
//     ▸ Its `ops` (0.2.2: the per-operator 潜能 / 练度, shared/protocol.js checkLoadoutOps — an operator of the 干员调配
//     roster or the 自选 owned pool, strict like the entries) travel with it: session.ops / seat.ops / seats[].ops and
//     match.setLoadout(playerId, loadout, ops); a message without `ops` sets none (every operator 潜能 6, 精英2 Lv.60).
//   * Operator ownership (干员持有, 0.2.0 补位, owner's decision 2026-10-05): room.ownership { notOwned } — the base chess
//     ids the player marked as not owned — is checked leniently (shared/protocol.js checkNotOwned: anything that is not
//     a droppable NORMAL chess is dropped, never the whole list; only a malformed list is BAD_MSG) and stored on the
//     session and the seat like the loadout. The match receives seats[].notOwned when it starts (bots: none — they own
//     every operator) and keeps it for its whole length: the setting is out of match ("局外设置，下一局生效"), so while
//     the room's match runs a new list is only stored for the next match (ROOM_STARTED 'stored for the next match',
//     never handed to the match). A spectator's list stays on its session.
//   * 自选编队 (0.2.0 DIY, the owner's decisions of 2026-10-05): room.diy { picks } — the player's picks for the four DIY
//     slots ({ [slotBaseId]: { charId, skillIndex?, uniEquipId? } | null }) — is checked leniently (shared/protocol.js
//     checkDiyPicks against the game data and the kit registry, server/sim/content/kits/index.js KITTED_CHARS: an
//     illegal pick — an operator without a kit, another tier's prototype, a prototype off its locked skill, a second slot
//     of one owned operator, the same operator twice in a tier, an unknown slot / skill / module — is dropped, never the
//     whole roster; only malformed picks are BAD_MSG) and stored on the session and the seat exactly like the
//     not-owned list: the match receives seats[].diy when it starts (bots: none — they field no 自选 piece [ASSUMED]),
//     and a change while it runs is stored for the next match (ROOM_STARTED 'stored for the next match'). Every
//     `welcome` carries `diyKitted` (welcomeInfo): the operators a DIY slot may field, so the client's picker offers
//     exactly what the server accepts.
//   * 干员皮肤 (docs/SKINS.md): room.skins { skins } — `{ [charId]: skinId }`, the appearance each operator wears — is
//     a plain map of charIds to skinIds, at most SKIN_LIMITS.entries (256 [ASSUMED]); a bad shape is BAD_MSG and does
//     not clear the stored choice. A charId the room's content does not have is dropped (shared/protocol.js
//     checkSkinSelection). An unknown skinId can do nothing worse than fail to resolve in the client's spineEntry.
//     Stored on the session and the seat. Unlike
//     the settings above there is NO phase gate: a match receives seats[].skins when it starts AND takes a later change
//     at once (match.setSkins, any phase), because the choice is public — a teammate sees your model — and cosmetic.
//     The room's members see a seat's map as room.state seats[].skins (human seats with a non-empty map only, so a room
//     without skins sends what it sent before): the waiting room's 名片干员 seat cards wear the outfit of the operator
//     they show (the maintainer's decision 4 of 2026-10-21; the client picks that operator's entry — ui/seatArt.js
//     seatCardSkin — exactly as a match card reads Match.publicView().players[].skins). A changed map is broadcast while
//     the room waits; during a match its m.public carries it, and the room.state at the match's end. [ASSUMED] The whole
//     map rides in room.state, not one skinId per card: a seat without a pick shows an operator its clients choose by
//     player id (ui/seatArt.js seatOperator), which the server does not compute.
//   * 名片干员 (PR #643 split 6): room.card { charId } — the operator whose portrait fills the player's seat card in the
//     waiting room, '' for none — is kept only when it is a visible charId of the room's chess.json (another id, a hidden
//     preset, a stand-in body or a 自选-only operator: BAD_MSG, the stored one stays). Stored on the session (it follows the player into
//     the next room) and the seat; the room's members see it as room.state seats[].card (human seats with a card only,
//     so a room without one sends what it sent before). Checked again when the player takes a seat (humanSeat): a card
//     the room's content does not have (a plugin operator picked in a room with gameplay plugins) is left off that seat
//     — the session keeps it, and the player's page sends the card it can show for the room (ui/loadoutSync.js
//     installCardSync). Cosmetic: no phase gate, never handed to a match. [ASSUMED] A card picked in this browser stands
//     in for the event's account assistant (名片形象, display_meta_table avatarTypeData ASSISTANT); the client's default
//     for a seat without one is ui/seatArt.js'.
//   * Content identity (DESIGN §32, the plugin system's first step): the lobby is given the server's vanilla content
//     (server/plugins/identity.js; none in unit tests that build a Lobby without it). Every `welcome` carries
//     `content: { vanilla: <cs> }` — and `plugins: <n>` when this server has n > 0 unofficial plugins (every class but a
//     language: the title screen's 「本服务器安装了 N 个插件」; a page fetches the catalogue only when n > 0 and something
//     needs it, so a server without plugins sends exactly what it sent before) —, every room's `room.state.content` is
//     `{ cs, vanilla: true, plugins: [] }` while it has
//     no plugin, and the match receives `cs`, which it copies into every BattleSpec (the sim never reads it;
//     diagnostics and replays name the content with it).
//   * The room's plugins (DESIGN §32 P1a — cosmetic plugins only): room.setPlugins { plugins: [{ id }] } — host-only,
//     before the match, and ▸ like a difficulty change it un-readies the other humans. The lobby asks the server's
//     visual sets (server/plugins/visualSet.js resolve: loaded cosmetic plugins of scope `room`, their requirements
//     switched on, in load order, within the size limit — PLUGIN_UNKNOWN / PLUGIN_BLOCKED / PLUGIN_DEPENDENCY /
//     PLUGIN_CONFLICT / PLUGIN_LIMIT otherwise; none given to the Lobby → PLUGIN_UNKNOWN) and the room's content becomes
//     `{ cs, vanilla: true, vs, plugins: [{ id, version, class, hash, auto? }], warnings, bytes }`: `cs` stays the vanilla
//     one — art never changes a battle, so the match, its BattleSpecs and the golden results are those of the original
//     content and ▸ such a match counts as the original game in the statistics overview (the owner's decision of
//     2026-10-13: gameplay and numbers unchanged) —, `vs` names the
//     art every member's page draws with (/vs/<vs16>/overlay.json, composed by public/js/content.js on the page's own
//     manifest). An empty list brings back
//     exactly the vanilla shape above. The set is the room's: kept across its matches and a host change, held in the
//     visual sets while the room uses it (hold / release) and gone with the room. The same set again (the same `vs`)
//     un-readies nobody; ▸ when only its 「自动」 marks changed (a plugin first switched on automatically is now chosen, or
//     the other way round) the new state is broadcast without un-readying. A request that changes nothing (the same `vs`
//     and the same marks) — or a refused one — leaves the host's result replay (a settlement screen still open:
//     dropReplay; a change is the host moving on). ▸ When a plugin of the room's set changes on disk while the room holds
//     it (the visual sets' onStale, after the registry read the folders again), the host is told once (an m.toast: apply
//     the room's plugins again — the panel's 「重新应用」 sends the same list, which resolves to the set of the files as
//     they are now) — during a match, once the room is back in its lobby (onMatchEnd), when it can be done; nothing
//     changes by itself — ▸ but in a room the plugin studio names (DESIGN §32.9: `autoApplyPlugins`, set by
//     server/studio/index.js — a room whose host is the plugin's author or whose host is its only player) the same choice
//     is applied again at once, during a match too (refreshPlugins: art never changes a battle, the `cs` stays the vanilla
//     one; nobody is un-readied), and the host is told only when that fails.
//   * Gameplay plugins (DESIGN §32.6, P1c): room.setPlugins also takes the server's content plugins (data: numbers,
//     records, modes). The lobby's `plugins` (server/plugins/roomSets.js) closes the list over its requirements, refuses
//     conflicts, other classes and scopes, what the server owner's plugins/config.json does not allow and — unless it
//     allows them — gameplay plugins made for other game versions (PLUGIN_INCOMPATIBLE), and builds the room's content set:
//     a `cs` of its own (server/plugins/contentSets.js; at most limits.maxSets such sets held by rooms at once, else
//     PLUGIN_BUSY). The room's content is then `{ cs, vanilla: false, plugins: [{ id, version, class, hash, auto? }],
//     warnings, bytes, dataBytes, vs?, modes?, modeId? }` and ▸ the room is held to it like to a visual set (holdContent /
//     releaseContent). Its members' pages load and check that set (/cs/<cs16>/…, public/js/content.js) and say so with
//     room.contentReady { cs } — `seats[].content` (and `spectators[].content`) is 'loading' | 'ready' | 'failed' in such a
//     room only, reset to 'loading' when the set changes and when the member's socket drops (a reloaded page loads it
//     again); room.ready { ready: true } and room.start wait for every player's 'ready' (CONTENT_NOT_READY). A new room
//     starts with the policy's `default` plugins (none: the original game).
//     room.setMode { modeId } (host, before the match): an official mode of the room's type sets the difficulty; a mode
//     of the room's content set (content.modes, same room type) becomes content.modeId — the match's modeId — until the
//     host picks a difficulty or the set no longer has it; ▸ like a difficulty change it un-readies the other humans.
//     The match of such a room runs in that set's match host (server/match/host/ — a child process, a worker thread with
//     SP_MATCH_HOST=worker: hosts.create — the match is a MatchProxy whose answers are Promises), with opts.cs = the set's cs, opts.requireCs (a b.result naming another
//     content is refused) and opts.vs; ▸ every message and event of such a room is handled in order, one at a time, on
//     the room's own queue (serial): a request waits for the previous one's answer. A vanilla room never queues — its
//     match is in this process and answers at once, exactly as before. A loadout, 干员持有 list or 自选 roster stored while
//     the player was in a room of another content is filtered to the room's data when its match starts (an id the set
//     does not know is dropped, the rest kept — design study §6.9), and room.loadout / room.ownership / room.diy are
//     checked against the room's own data (and its 自选 list). When the worker stops (a crash, the watchdog), the match
//     ends with summary.reason 'plugin-crash' | 'plugin-hang' | 'plugin-start' and the room is back in its lobby.
//   * Spectator seats (community report #26, owner's decision 2026-10-04 — a remake feature, the official room has none):
//     room.spectate { code } takes one of a co-op room's MAX_SPECTATORS (2) spectator seats, in its lobby or while its
//     match runs (▸ solo rooms: ROOM_FULL). A spectator is not a player: never in `seats`, never counted for the 1–4 players
//     or the start gate, never host, never keeps a room alive (a room whose last human leaves closes with room.closed
//     {empty} for its spectators). It receives room.state (`spectators: [{ playerId, name, connected }]`) and every match
//     broadcast (m.public, m.ticker, m.emote, b.pool — public data); the match registers it (opts.spectators /
//     addSpectator) and shows it fields like an eliminated player (b.start watch / m.field), never an m.private. It may
//     only g.watch (the heavy bucket, like every watcher), g.leave / room.leave, and room.loadout / room.ownership /
//     room.diy (stored for its session, never handed to the match); anything else → SPECTATOR (▸ emotes too). Host: room.removeSpectator { playerId } any
//     time → room.closed {kicked} to it. A spectator in a LOBBY room may take a free player seat with room.join of the same
//     code; a player never switches to spectating in place (ALREADY). Disconnect / grace / reconnect / expiry work as for
//     a player seat (the seat is kept and given back on resume).
//   * Official versions (DESIGN §37.23, M1; shared/versions.js, server/versions.js): a room plays one official version,
//     `room.version` — room.create { version? } (omitted: the server's default version; refused VERSION_UNKNOWN when this
//     server does not enable it, VERSION_UNSUPPORTED when it does not offer the room mode, its data failed to load
//     (server/versions.js available; welcome then omits it) or the server owner's fixed plugins (plugins/config.json
//     rooms: fixed) cannot play it; a difficulty the version lacks is lowered — the highest it
//     offers below, else its lowest: 终极 → 绝境). A room of 第二期下半 (act2autochess, the code constant DEFAULT_VERSION)
//     is exactly the room of before: no new key in its room.state, its match in this process. Another version's room:
//     room.state.version, its content `{ cs: <the version's cs>, vanilla: true, version, plugins }` (official — never
//     unofficial; cosmetic plugins only: gameplay plugins play 第二期下半 only, VERSION_UNSUPPORTED), every member's page
//     loads and checks that version's data like a gameplay plugin's set (room.needsContent: seats[].content, contentReady,
//     CONTENT_NOT_READY), room.setDifficulty / room.setMode accept only the version's modes (BAD_TARGET), settings are
//     checked against its data, and its match runs in that version's match host (server/match/host/, kind 'version':
//     opts.version, opts.requireCs) — never in this process, whose module singletons hold 第二期下半's data (INTERNAL
//     without one, unless a test gave its own MatchClass).
//     The version switch, before the match, modelled on 重刷 (server/match/match/setupVote.js): the host proposes
//     (room.proposeVersion { version }: refused NOT_IN_ROOM, SPECTATOR, NOT_HOST, ROOM_STARTED, VERSION_UNKNOWN,
//     VERSION_UNSUPPORTED — the room mode, or gameplay plugins on and the target not 第二期下半 —, ALREADY, VERSION_VOTE,
//     RATE — `versionProposeGapMs` (300 ms) since the last proposal, `versionRetryMs` (5 s) after a declined or expired
//     vote [ASSUMED] —, NOT_READY — a seated human offline —, VERSION_UNSUPPORTED when the target's data failed to load,
//     and VERSION_UNSUPPORTED again when the room's cosmetic plugins do not resolve on the target, checked last);
//     ▸ a lone active human switches at once; otherwise a vote opens: voters = the seated humans then (seat order; AI and
//     spectators never vote), the host counted as agreed, `versionVoteMs` (60 s [ASSUMED]: a room has no clock to pause,
//     unlike 重刷) to answer. room.versionVote { voteId, agree }: a decline cancels (toast to every member), the last
//     agreement switches. room.cancelVersionVote { voteId } (host). A seat taken by a human (a join, a spectator sitting
//     down), a player seat freed (leave, kick, grace timeout, expiry), a host change, a voter's socket dropping and a
//     match start void it (toast); spectators coming or going and AI seats do not. While it is open room.start,
//     room.setPlugins and room.setMode answer VERSION_VOTE. room.state.versionVote { id, proposerId, version, voters,
//     agreed, remainingMs } while open (remainingMs: a duration by the lobby's clock, never a wall clock).
//     The switch (applyVersion): room.version, the difficulty lowered as at create, the content the version's base with
//     the room's cosmetic plugins applied again (none when they do not resolve there), every member's page loading it
//     again, the other humans un-readied, the WHOLE result replay dropped (its frames name the old version's chess ids),
//     every human seat's loadout / 潜能 / 干员持有 / 自选 cleared (the pages send them again) and a seat card the version
//     lacks dropped. ▸ A setting sent in such a room before its page reported the room's content ready is kept unverified
//     (the version's chess ids are reused with other operators: chess_char_1_02 is 角峰 in 第二期, 讯使 in 第一期) — a
//     version room's match then drops that loadout's skill / module choices and that 干员持有 list whole, while 潜能 /
//     练度 and 自选 (keyed by charId) are checked again against the version's data (seatSettings); a setting checked for
//     another content keeps only the ids whose operator (charId) is the same in both data sets.

   * 哪几个包，此前唯一的办法是解散重开，而重开会把已经坐进来的博士全赶出去。这一格让「改集合」不再等于「重开房」。

   * 改完**立刻物化**这一份（`roomAssets.forRoom`），所以新摘要的数据面在广播出去之前就已经有了。
   *
   * **三道守卫**（全部点名拒绝，一条都不静默）：
   *   1. 只有房主（`NOT_HOST`）—— 集合是这一房所有人的共同前提，不是谁都能改的；
   *   2. 对局已开 ⇒ `MOD_SET_LOCKED`：正在跑的那一局拿的是**开局那一刻**的集合（`startMatch` 已经把它交给
   *      Match / BattleSpec），现在改只会让「声明的」与「正在跑的」变成两个真相；
   *   3. **任一真人座位 `ready === true`** ⇒ `MOD_SET_LOCKED`：那个人是按**旧集合**对齐完才点的准备就绪
   *      （W-D 的客户端硬门），他的字节可能正好缺新集合里的包。**AI 座位不算**：`addBot` 建出来的座位天生
   *      `ready: true`，而 AI 从不对齐任何字节 —— 照字面把它收进这条判据，房主一加 AI 队友就再也改不了集合，
   *      而那条拒绝说的还是一句与事实无关的话。
   *
   * **双检**（借 Ave-Mujica 的设计：进 handler 先判一次，真正应用之前再判一次）。今天这个 handler 从头到尾是
   * **同步**的（没有 await、没有回调），所以第二次判**不可能**被别的会话插进来 —— 但「守卫」与「改动」之间的距离
   * 是这段代码唯一的脆弱点，而「另一个会话刚刚让某个座位就绪 / 开了局」在任何**未来**的异步化（读盘、物化、钩子）
   * 里会立刻变成真的。所以第二次判写在这里，并且紧挨着那两行赋值：谁把它挪远，谁就把这条不变量挪走了。
   *
   * **房间级钩子的边界**（DESIGN §28.20）：包声明的 `server.room` 钩子在 `install(room)` 那一刻拿到的
   * `ctx.room.modIds` 是**快照**。新集合里该装的那几个钩子包与**已经装上的**不一致时，改集合会让某个包的观察面
   * 与房间的真实集合对不上（它按旧集合装上，却继续看着一个不再声明它的房间）⇒ 点名拒绝，而不是让它偷偷漂。
   * 只改「不含房间钩子的那几个包」时这条判据不挡路（两边算出来的钩子包名单相同）。
